This project is a modern chat application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to send messages, share files, and use emojis in a clean, user-friendly interface. The layout includes a sidebar for contacts and a main chat area for conversations. Messages show timestamps, delivery status, and can be deleted.

The app also includes a dark mode switch, a typing indicator, and responsive design for mobile devices. Bot replies are generated based on keywords or random responses to keep the conversation flowing. Styling is handled with CSS variables for easy theme switching, and animations make the chat feel smooth and interactive.

This chat app is a great starting point for building more advanced features like real-time messaging or multi-user support.
